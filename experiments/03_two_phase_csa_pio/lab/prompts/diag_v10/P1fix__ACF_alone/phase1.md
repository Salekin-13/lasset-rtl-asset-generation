THIS CALL: PHASE 1, CONCEPTUAL ASSETS

For each UNIT of the diagram:

1. Interface. Name information entering or leaving through the unit's INPUTS and OUTPUTS: data received, held or returned; settings and configuration; state and status; commands, requests and responses; events signaled to other modules.

2. Inside. Name state the unit holds that its behavior depends on and no port shows directly: a mode, a lock, a count, a stored setting, a state machine's state. Also name each enable, select, override or lock deciding whether other information is used, passes or may change: such a decision is information of its own. Neither sentence covers sequencing state outside a coprocessor (a rule below).

3. Merge and split. Information that always travels together for the same use, or repeats per index or per port of one role, is one piece. Information with different uses is separate, even on a shared port. An internal signal only timing one step of other information (an increment pulse, a started flag, a one-cycle request) is part of what it times, not its own decision. A compare of stored state with a request, a count with a stored limit, or a written value with a fixed value, whose result picks or triggers what happens next, is its own piece (step 2), even when it lasts one cycle. Hold it where computed; never merge it into its inputs or the action it triggers. Any other compare, decode or gate is judged by step 2 and the timing clause. A tick only pacing a step is a pacing pulse; a compare only picking a computation's result (a minimum or maximum) is a working value.

4. Rubric. Per piece, answer each question "yes" only when both parts hold: first, what the information is, judged from what the RTL does with it; second, a mechanism the RTL shows or the black-box rule (section 1) gives.
   Confidentiality. Assume the IC integrating the IP requires confidentiality protections. Is this information, received as input or generated inside the IP, something an integrator may consider secret? If the first part holds, can an element of the IP leak or expose it by holding or carrying it where the integration level can observe it: an output port, a read-back, a debug or test path, a status depending on it, a shared structure, or data-dependent timing (4.4)? Phase 2 judges authorization, so a designed use never makes the second part "no".
   Integrity. Assume the IC integrating the IP requires integrity protections. Is this information material an integrator may deem sensitive, or a state or configuration setting that must be immutable during certain operations or modes? If the first part holds, can an element of the IP modify it?
   Availability. Does this information gate (enable, block or select) an output port or an input port's use, or would the IP or IC stop working without it? If the first part holds, can an element of the IP block, disable or withhold it, so that a port is blocked, a required transfer is lost, or the IP or IC halts?
   Undermined expected behavior. Does a privileged mode, an override, a bypass, test-packet injection or similar integration-level behavior act on this information? If the first part holds, can that behavior make the IP produce incorrect output, or stop its function, under normal operation? Focus on what may be compromised.

5. Keep. Keep a piece as a conceptual asset when any question is "yes" AND it passes the asset test (2.3); list the rest under "Not Kept". Phase 2 sees only kept concepts, starting from their held lines.

6. Anchor. Under "Enters Through" list each unit port whose value is carried (2.2) into the information; under "Leaves Through", each unit port written by an element carrying it; either may be empty. Skip ports that only decide the information or that it only decides. When a state machine, apart from reset, changes state only at steps a peer device's clock paces, and its next state depends only on its current state and one bit of a non-record input port (directly or through synchronizer stages), that port, never the peer's clock line, is the input port setting the state (2.6), though only conditions test its bit (an implicit flow, 2.2). List that port under "Enters Through" of the concept holding that state; the skip above does not apply to it. Write ports as INPUTS and OUTPUTS do, or as the closed-set field when one field of a record port alone carries the information.

Rules:
- Describe a conceptual asset by what the information is, not an element name. A diagram arrow shows a flow, not an asset.
- Precedence. A rule's bar is its sentence saying information is not a conceptual asset or not a piece of its own. What a rule judges as usual or does not cover is spared only from that rule's bar.
- Reading a rule. Check its scope, then each criterion, then each exception it lists, in that order, against the RTL; where a criterion says "only", "every" or "one element", check every assignment or use, not one. Its outcome follows only for an element in scope that meets every criterion (one, where marked "any of") and that no listed exception covers.
- Access command fields (a).
  Scope: Accesses on a record port (never on non-record ports, even ones together carrying an access) addressing this unit's own registers, FIFOs, locks or memory words (not a cache's copies).
  Criteria (any of): (1) the fields only saying whether an access happens, its direction and which register, FIFO or bytes it reaches (a strobe, a read or write bit, register-select address bits, byte enables; an address indexing a memory's stored words is the access address, not one of them); (2) a write enable whose assignment reads only these fields and that only lets a register or FIFO take the written data.
  Exceptions: Not covered: a request held until served, a select routing it on, and a strobe driven on to a unit output port other than as an acknowledge; an operation's start pulse (not an access's strobe or write enable).
  Outcome: they are part of the information the access writes or reads, not information of their own; such a field whose value a register takes as its new content belongs to that register's piece. They are not pieces of their own, although steps 1 and 2, Build-time values and Per-region checks would keep some: keep no concept for them.
  Evidence: do not list them under "Enters Through", and cite no line only testing them, or only assigning such a write enable, as a held line.
- Access command fields (b).
  Scope: A signal of its own decoded from these fields.
  Criteria (any of): (1) gates or masks what a read returns (a read enable, a select also masking read data); (2) pops a FIFO of data the unit generates itself.
  Exceptions: An inline condition is no such signal, nor is a strobe of a FIFO that Port buffers covers.
  Outcome: it is its own piece (step 2): name it by what it decides; no step-3 clause folds it.
  Evidence: hold it at the line assigning it; list none of the fields it is decoded from under "Enters Through", and cite no line (a) bars as its held line.

Follow this format strictly: write every key shown, spelled and ordered as shown, in every object, and no other key. Each object starts with its own identifier: "Concept ID" in a conceptual asset, "Candidate Name" in a not-kept entry.
Number the Concept IDs C1, C2, ... across the whole module.
Each objective in "Objectives At Risk" comes from a "yes": confidentiality gives C, integrity gives I, availability gives A, and undermined expected behavior gives the objective the behavior breaks (I when it makes the output incorrect, A when it stops the function).
